RICE is one of the many frameworks used by PMs while prioritizing a feature for the product. RICE is a scientific way of scoring each project so that it is not just gut feeling but a concrete score that drives decision making. RICE stands for ***Reach, Impact, Confidence and Effort.***

# Reach #

This represent the number of customers who are going to get directly impacted by the feature for a given time period. It could be customers per month/quarter or transaction per month/quarter. It depends on the metrics that you are tracking.

# Impact #

The overall contribution of the feature to the product. Again, this will depend on the metrics that you are tracking. Some questions to ask are:
      

 1. What benefits does the customer get from this feature?
 2. How does this feature impact the conversion rate?

Understand what the feature is and try to frame questions relating the feature and the metrics you are tracking. There are different ways of scoring such as 1-10 scale, intercom five-tired scoring method etc.

# Confidence #

By what percentage does the data substantiate the feature or project? Intercom has come up with a 3 tiered confidence score:

 - 100% - high confidence
 - 80% - medium confidence
 - 50% - low confidence

***Anything less than 50% will be considered a moonshot.***

# Effort #

You can have all your fancy metrics like conversion rate, churn rate *but this is the real metric.* This represents the **actual person-hours** required to complete the feature or project. This includes design, engineering and product efforts. This can be represented in hours, days or even months.

# How do we calculate RICE score for a project? #

The project/feature with highest RICE score will get the highest priority.

RICE is one of the framework you can use for prioritization. There are other frameworks such as **MoSCoW, Value Vs Effort, Story Mapping method** etc. It all depends on the type of feature/product and the metrics that you are trying to track.
