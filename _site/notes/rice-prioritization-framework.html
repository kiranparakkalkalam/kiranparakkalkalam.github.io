RICE is a scientific way of scoring each project so that it is not just gut feeling but a concrete score that drives decision making. RICE stands for <strong><em>Reach, Impact, Confidence and Effort.</em></strong></p><h1 id="reach">Reach</h1><p>This represent the number of customers who are going to get directly impacted by the feature for a given time period. It could be customers per month/quarter or transaction per month/quarter. It depends on the metrics that you are tracking.</p><h1 id="impact">Impact</h1><p>The overall contribution of the feature to the product. Again, this will depend on the metrics that you are tracking. Some questions to ask are:</p><ol><li>What benefits does the customer get from this feature?</li><li>How does this feature impact the conversion rate?</li></ol><p>Understand what the feature is and try to frame questions relating the feature and the metrics you are tracking. There are different ways of scoring such as 1-10 scale, intercom five-tired scoring method etc.</p><h1 id="confidence">Confidence</h1><p>By what percentage does the data substantiate the feature or project? Intercom has come up with a 3 tiered confidence score:</p><ul><li>100% - high confidence</li><li>80% - medium confidence</li><li>50% - low confidence</li></ul><p><strong><em>Anything less than 50% will be considered a moonshot.</em></strong></p><h1 id="effort">Effort</h1><p>You can have all your fancy metrics like conversion rate, churn rate <em>but this is the real metric.</em> This represents the <strong>actual person-hours</strong> required to complete the feature or project. This includes design, engineering and product efforts. This can be represented in hours, days or even months.</p><h1 id="how-do-we-calculate-rice-score-for-a-project">How do we calculate RICE score for a project?</h1><p><a href="https://svbtleusercontent.com/vj2mbeR5KaMFNMcvnLxVrE0xspap.png"><img src="https://svbtleusercontent.com/vj2mbeR5KaMFNMcvnLxVrE0xspap_small.png" alt="Screenshot 2021-05-13 at 8.58.02 AM.png" /></a></p><p>The project/feature with highest RICE score will get the highest priority.</p><p>RICE is one of the framework you can use for prioritization. There are other frameworks such as <strong>MoSCoW, Value Vs Effort, Story Mapping method</strong> etc. It all depends on the type of feature/product and the metrics that you are trying to track.</p></article><div class="back"> <a href="/">Back</a></div></main></body></html>
